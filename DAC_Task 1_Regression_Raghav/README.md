# Problem Statement

- [ ] This is the brief description of the dataset of the "heart.csv" and the "2015.csv" 
- [ ] It tests the World Happiness Report and the Heart Problem to analyze the Classification and Regression Model 
- [ ] It predicts the accuracy of the models by importing the different packages available, graph visualization and performing the preprocessing function on the dataset
- [ ] Thus, we can analyze them clearly using the various functions in Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib

# Datasets

Heart Problem Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/nareshbhat/health-care-data-set-on-heart-attack-possibility

World Happiness Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

# Models Used

- [ ] The "heart.csv" contains 76 attributes where the column "target" refers to the presence of the heart disease in the patient where 0 refers to no or less chances of heart attack and 1 refers to high risk of heart attack
- [ ] The "2015.csv" contains the Happiness Report in the year 2015
- [ ] The Classification model uses the former dataset consisting of Age, Sex, Cholestrol, Blood Pressure, Fasting Blood Sugar, Maximum Heart Rate achieved 
- [ ] The Regression model uses the latter dataset consisting of the Country with the Happiness Rank, Standard Error, Life Expectancy, Economy etc 

# Tasks to perform on these dataset

- [ ] Perform the Classification and Regression Model using the Heart Problem and World Happiness (2015) datasets
- [ ] Calculate the accuracy of the modles so created by importing the various packages needed, visualizing them using graphs like histogram, bar chart etc
- [ ] I also downloaded the dataset and loaded it using Pandas and then removed all the null values from the dataset
- [ ] I also explored more commands and features on my own which helped me gain lots of insights
- [ ] Thus, I analysed the dataset provided to me given using relevant functions in Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib

# Future Work

To further implement the further course of action to extend the functions of the Classification and Regression model that I was not able to implement the tasks that I was not able to develop in this task to enhance the performance of the task
